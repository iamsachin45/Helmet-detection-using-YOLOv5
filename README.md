# Problem Statement

Nowadays we have seen that many two-wheelers died because they don't wear a helmet. So detect helmets using smart camera surveillance we can detect helmets and break these types of accidents.

# Idea

From smart camera surveillance we can break these deaths in accident.

# Dataset
I have used custom dataset.Images are taken from internet.You can also use these images to train and test your model.
